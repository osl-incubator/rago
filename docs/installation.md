# Installation

## Stable release

To install Rago, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install rago
```

This is the preferred method to install Rago, as it will always install the most
recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this
[Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.

## From sources

The sources for Rago can be downloaded from the
[Github repo](https://github.com/osl-incubator/rago.git).

You can either clone the public repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osl-incubator/rago.git
```

Or download the
[tarball](https://github.com/osl-incubator/rago.git/tarball/main):

```bash
curl -OJL https://github.com/osl-incubator/rago.git/tarball/main
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```bash
poetry install
```
